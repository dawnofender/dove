ideas: 
- maybe instead of the universe being a thingy with a physics component, it would be simpler to have a universe class that extends thingy and comes with physics by default.
    - probably not doing this tho
- more thingy types, or template, with specific features & amount of children
    - useful for octree & similar data structures 
- 'player controller' is boring. lets fix that
    - 'you' but i feel like that should be reserved for something personal to the player, like their profile, as a component on their host thingy. 
    - 'input' or something related to isolate controls
    - 'sight' for graphics


high priority: 
- connect mesh renderer with transform
- sync rigidbody transform and object transform
    -for each rigidbody, set the transform to the rigidbody's position, and after updates, set each rigidbody to the transform position
- implement equivalent of materials, a layer between meshrenderers and shaders that can handle uniforms and be reused

do sometime: 
- some variables may need global access for complicated systems, like the camera
- store these in a universe object?


eventually: 
- octree based LOD where closest 8 on each depth level get rendered and nodes are mapped to what objects they contain

high priority:
- try using mesh regeneration for updating chunk thingies
- simplify duplicates 
- write data to file
- load data from images (heightmap & 'matter maps')? 
    - would be great for quick testing before worring about complex world generation


do sometime:
- generate smooth mesh based on density of cell
- try storing cell addresses (bitfields representing indexes in parents, directions on how to get to the cell) 
    - these could be used to calculate position on bit-level?
- improve simplify duplicates by including orientation - flipped / rotated duplicates
- map cells to matter which store actual composition of the cell (objects must be optimized in a similar way)

do eventually:
- imposters for large cells, generate depth and normals straight from cell data
