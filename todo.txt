todo

high priority:
- proper mesh data updating 
- rework chunks for the 3rd time to just check every 32000 positions they contain instead of taking info from map, see if thats faster
- rework neighbor finding to take advantage of new maps
- simplify duplicates 
- write data to file
- load data from heightmap

do sometime:
- generate smooth mesh based on density of cell
- try storing cell addresses (bitfields representing indexes in parents, directions on how to get to the cell) 
    - these could be used to calculate position on bit-level?
- improve simplify duplicates by including orientation - flipped / rotated duplicates
- map cells to matter which store actual composition of the cell (objects must be optimized in a similar way)

do eventually:
- imposters for large cells, generate depth and normals straight from cell data
