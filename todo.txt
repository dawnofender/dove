todo

high priority:
- generate world from near to far, using breadth-first search as quick culling to generate less chunks

do sometime:
- generate smooth mesh based on density of cell
- set of unordered maps for each depth level of maps of position to leaf cells (potentially good way to find same-level neighbors across borders?)
- optimize by having duplicate cells trees point to the same tree
    - include orientation? flipped / rotated duplicates
- map cells to matter which store actual composition of the cell (objects must be optimized in a similar way)
- implement "thing"s (like gameobjects with components) and make each chunk or maybe each cell a thing (they will store a minimum of like almost no data)

do eventually:
- imposters for large cells, generate depth and normals straight from cell data
