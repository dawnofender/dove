todo
- generate smooth mesh based on density of cell
- optimize by having duplicate cells trees point to the same tree
    - include orientation? flipped / rotated duplicates
- breadth-first search for culling
- hash map of cells & position & depth
- cells point to matter which store actual composition of the cell (objects must be optimized in a similar way)
distant future
- imposters for large cells, generate depth and normals straight from cell data
